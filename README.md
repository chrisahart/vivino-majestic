# Majestic + Vivino Chrome extension

Extension to display Vivino wine score on Majestic wines, to aid in purchasing decisions. 

While this extension is under review, you may clone this repository and select 'Load unpacked' under chrome://extensions/ to use this extension.

This extension works with [Majestic wines](www.majestic.co.uk) and [Vivino](www.vivino.com), requiring host permissions to access both websites.

Some basic analysis can be found under in /analysis folder. Data was downloaded from the Majestic wines website (www.majestic.co.uk), limited to currently in stock red wines. The Vivino rating and Majestic Wines price is plotted for all countries, and also for all wine regions within each country. A [.csv file](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/blob/main/analysis/data/wines_rating-above-4.0_price-below-20.csv) is included containing wines with a Vivino rating above 4.0 and a price below Â£20, representing the greatest value.
