# Majestic wines + Vivino Chrome extension

Chrome extension to display the [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com) wine score on the [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk) website. The official version of the extension can be downloaded [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/majestic%2Bvivino/neohjloinpdpfddkjfcagikdgepjbmee). The open source development version can also be downloaded from my [Github repository](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/tree/main), to install select 'Load unpacked' under 'chrome://extensions' and open the extension folder of the cloned repository.

This extension works with [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk) and [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com), requiring host permissions to access both websites. To use, simply use the [Majestic wines](https://www.majestic.co.uk) search engine and after a few seconds the wines and their ratings, price and region will be displayed in a table on the bottom right of the screen. [Example screenshot](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/blob/main/extension/screenshot.png). I recommend a maximum 'View per page' of 18, as Vivino will temporarily block your IP address if you submitted too many requests.

Some basic analysis can be found under in the [analysis folder](https://github.com/chrisahart/vivino-majestic/tree/main/analysis), with a blog post available on my [personal website](https://chrisahart.github.io/posts/2023/2-majestic_wines-red).
